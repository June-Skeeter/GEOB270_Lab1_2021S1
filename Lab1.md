# Introduction 

In Part I this lab you will be introduced to ESRI's ArcGIS Pro software by several tutorials on the ESRI website. In Part II we'll do a quick example, applying modern GIS methods to a foundational study in Epidemiology.

## Learning Objectives

•	Learn about different data types 
•	display map features 
•	add data to your map 
•	manipulate data tables 
•	create a map (layout) 
•	save your map and associated data files 

## Setting Up & Saving Your Work

* See the Lab Details page for information on how to access ArcPro using your own computer or a Geography Department computer.

* If you are using ArcPro installed on your own computer, you can manage your files however works best for you.  However, if you are working on a Geography lab computer, follow the instructions on the lab details page closely.



# Part 1: A “Quick Start” to ArcGIS Pro Software 

Demonstrate basic use of GIS software ArcGIS Pro by completing 3 ArcGIS Pro “Quick Start” tutorials from ESRI (Environmental Systems Research Institute).  The following tutorials will give you a brief overview of the skills you will be building on each lab. By the end of the term you will have become comfortable utilizing these GIS skills/tools. The three tutorials are: 
•	Introducing ArcGISPro (~25 minutes) 
•	Explore your data (~45 minutes) 
•	Author a Map (~30 minutes) 


## Step 1: Setting up the ESRI campus access 

•	Using your favorite web browser, go to http://www.esri.com/training/main. 
•	Under the top navigation bar click on Sign in. **If you have purchased ArcGIS Pro, you can sign in through your UBC ArcGIS online account. If you are using the lab computers, and don’t already have one, ‘create a new public account’. 
•	Once signed in, navigate to the ArcGIS Pro Quick Start Tutorial web page. 
•	You will be sent your account email, check your spam if you do not get it right away. 


## Step 2: "Introducing ArcGISPro" (Tutorial 1) 
On the left side of your screen, click Learn the basics tab you’ll be redirected to the Introducing ArcGIS Pro page. Watch the Video and then work your way through the tutorial. You will get points by demonstrating your completion of the tutorial by completing the following checkpoints. 
**It is highly recommended you complete these checkpoint questions during or immediately after your completion of the tutorial. 
1)	Click on the Central Wellington_3d Map and hold down until the docking icon appears. Dock it to the right side of the screen. In the Bookmarks tab click on ‘Jervois Quay’ so that both maps zoom to that view. Upload a screenshot with both the Wellington City basemap (left) and Central Wellington_3d in side by side view. 
2)	Toggle to the Central Wellington Map. Open the Buildings attribute table, what is the 
‘Maximum Direct Solar Radiation’ of the building with an ‘OBJECTID’ of 14? (Just after Step 6 under the section Working with Contextual Tabs).  


## Step 3: "Explore your Data Tutorial" (Tutorial 2) 
Now click the the ‘Explore your data’ tab under Learn the Basics. To the right you can see a list of core GIS skills this tutorial will cover. Watch the video and begin to work your way through the tutorial. Complete the following checkpoints/questions as you work through it. 
3)	In the New Zealand Map, click on the ‘Canterbury’ region. What is the area in (square kilometers) of this region? (After Step 3, under Explore the regions and their attributes) 
4)	Open the attribute table for ‘Regions’ and locate the Sheep_2014 Column, using the Sort Ascending tool, report which region had the fewest sheep in 2014, and what the total population was in that region.  
5)	In the Regions Table right click the row with Tasman listed under region, and click pop-up. Take a screenshot of your full ArcGISPro window, demonstrating the altered alias names (e.g. ‘Area in Square Km instead of Aea_SQ_KM) that you changed in the steps above. (After Step 16, In the ‘Design Fields’ section) 
6)	When Calculating the Summary Statistics for the South Island of new Zealand try changing the Statistic Type to Mean, rename the output to south_island_statistic_mean. Check the results, what is the mean number of Beef Cattle on the South Island in 2014? (After step 13 under Summarize Table Values). 
7)	In the ‘Fields’ section, select Sheep 1994 instead. Relabel the Y axis as Number of Sheep. X axis should still be Region Name, and Title- New Zealand Sheep by Region in 1994. Upload a screenshot of your ArcGISPro window including your Chart of the Distribution of Sheep by region in 1994. (Complete after ‘Chart Sheep Distribution by region’). 
 

## Step 4: "Author a map Tutorial" (Tutorial 3) 
Now Scroll click the ‘Author a map’ tab under the Learn the Basics. Watch the video and then complete the tutorial. Complete the following checkpoints/questions as you go along. 
*Note: The Author A Map Data weblink is broken. The correct link is:

Downloading and saving your map 
Extract data from Downloads to the C:/temp folder. 
Save your project to the C:/temp folder as well (REMINDER: Move your work to your personal H:/ drive when done for the day) 
8)	Open the metadata for DOC tracks, who are these data credited to (full name)? And what is the purpose of the data? 
9)	Open the attribute table for your new North New Zealand trails layer. What type of vector/shape are these features? 
10)	Using your map and attribute data, what are the names of three tracks within 150 meters of mangroves? How did you find this out? 
11)	Test out some different colors for symbology of the trails and mangroves, zoom out so that the North Island is centered in the map frame. Take a screenshot of your work and upload it here.

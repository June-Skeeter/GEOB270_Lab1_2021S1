# Introduction 

In this lab you will be introduced to ESRI's ArcGIS Pro software by several tutorials on the ESRI website. Then we'll do a quick example, applying modern GIS methods to a foundational study in Epidemiology.

* The rest of the labs will build on this basic knowledge.  Each lab will be more complex than the next. 
* All software developed by ESRI is proprietary – i.e. is costly, and not free and open source. As part of UBC’s site license for the software, you have access to this software in our geography labs, or you can purchase a student license for your laptops (see course syllabus). 
* There is also a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) package called QGIS with similar functionality to the ArcGIS software packages. Although in this course you will learn and use ArcGIS Pro for labs, upon completion of the course, you will also be able to quickly pick up QGIS as the concepts are the same; only the user interface (UI) is different.

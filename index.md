# Accessing ArcGIS Pro

See the Lab Details page on Canvas for information on how to access ArcPro via the Geography Department lab or download ArcPro on your own computer.

# Saving Your Work
If you are using ArcPro installed on your own computer, you can manage your files however works best for you.  **However**, if you are working on a Geography lab computer, *follow the instructions on the lab details page closely.*

# Getting Started
The first step is opening ArcPro.  You can find it using the Windows start tab or search bar.  When ArcPro opens choose the Map under Blank Templates as shown below.  Then create your new project.  I've named mine Lab1_Project so I can easily identify it.  This will be the name of the folder your project resides in.  Set the location to an appropriate workspace.  I am working on my own computer, and my workspace workspace is "C:\GEOG270\2021_S1\Labs".  This is the location where the project folder will be reside.  If you are unfamiliar with the Windows operating system (OS), it might be helpful to take a few moments to learn about the differences between Windows and the OS (Mac, Linux) you are used to working with.
